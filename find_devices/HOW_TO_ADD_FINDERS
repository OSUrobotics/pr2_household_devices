To add a finder script:

1) Write a service node in Python and save it to
.../find_devices/scripts/find_whatever_you_want.py

2) Your service name should be of the form 'find_*'

3) Modify the launch file to run your node, thus advertising the
service. The launch file is here:
.../find_devices/launch/find_things.launch

4) The main interface node will detect the new service and make it
available to the user via the GUI.
